# DISCRIPTION OF THE TASK


This task involves the creation and configuration of cloud storage using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS). It begins by accessing an existing cloud account with the necessary permissions to manage storage services. A new storage bucket is then created by specifying a unique name and selecting an appropriate region. For AWS S3, options such as versioning, server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS), and bucket policies are configured. In Google Cloud, similar configurations are applied, including selecting a storage class (Standard, Nearline, Coldline, or Archive), setting up uniform or fine-grained access controls, and enabling encryption using Google-managed or customer-managed keys. After the bucket is created, files can be uploaded through the web interface, command-line tools, or SDKs, with the ability to organize data using folders or naming prefixes. Lifecycle rules may be added to automatically manage data retention by deleting or transitioning objects based on age or version.
